This study addresses the problem of real-time face mask detection to enhance public safety during 
pandemics such as COVID-19. Using a dataset of images categorized as "with mask" and "without 
mask," we developed and compared two models for binary classification: a traditional machine learning 
model using a Random Forest classifier and a deep learning model based on the MobileNetV2 
architecture implemented in TensorFlow.
